## Summary of files added/edited recently:
Reverse chronological order of last update
- Folder: my_first_simulation – 1 Feb 2025
    - Created a a 'first simulation' in webots following the tutorial on the documentation.
    - Added simple world following the first step of tutoral.
- File: client_trial1.py – 1 Feb 2025
    - Created a simple python client code to test socket communication with a C++ server.
    - Client code was supposed to be used to connect to a C++ server code that would then be the actual controller of the AGV in webots, however we found out we could directly use a python controller in webots therefore client_trial1.py is just a test file and will not be used and is useless by its own.
